  # method. Instead of comparing two passwords directly
  # (which is impossible because we only have a one-way hash)
  # the == method calculates the candidate password_digest from
  # the password given and compares it to the password_digest
  # it was initialised with.
  # So, to recap: THIS IS NOT A STRING COMPARISON
